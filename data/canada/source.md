Category codes from this file:
https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/gncy/stts/opendata/charity/2016/codelist-en.pdf

PDF is horrible format.. so had to copy by typing by hand.. :(

Welfare
01, Organizations providing care other than treatment
02, Disaster Funds
03, (Welfare) Charitable Corporations
05, (Welfare) Charitable Trusts
09, Welfare organizations (not else classified)

Health
10, Hospitals
11, Services other than Hospitals
13, (Health) Charitable Corporations
15, (Health) Charitiable Trusts
19, Health organizations (not else classified)
..

this list seems to be beyond charities
I also don't see these codes in the 'general information' CSV file

There are also 'Program Area Codes' like this..

A1, Housing (seniors, low-income persons, and those with disabilities)
..
C1, Scholarships, bursaries, awards
..
etc

These seem to be for 'programs' not the charities themselves perse

The CSV file contains 'Program #1', 'Program #2' and 'Program #3'
So I could derive categories from that perhaps.
