USA has files split out:

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo1.csv
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo2.csv
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo3.csv
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo4.csv

So it would require a script to add string those files together,
or perhaps use seperate folders for each region.

As a test, I'm first going to add the eo1.csv file
